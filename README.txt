1. canny_edge.m

This is the function class file.
canny_edge(grayscale image, sigma, high threshold, low threshold)
And outputs a canny edge image.

2. canny_test.m

This is the test class file, including the image outputs with respectable sigma and thresholds values hard coded.
It runs over four different images, each step by pause. So press any keys to see the next image step.

Notice that the very first image is given as it is, and big.
Therefore the image collage after first pause will take some time to process.

Maximizing the window will result to have bigger size of images.

Thank you.
